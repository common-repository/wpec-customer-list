List table of customers with details of total orders, items and amount in sortable columns.
Sortable order history for each customer.
Per-user coupon codes with an auto reward system.

== Description ==

This add-on extends the functionality of the WP E-Commerce plugin by adding a list table of customers (registered users with at least one purchase) to the dashboard and users admin panels.

Fully sortable column entries display the details of total orders, total items and total amount spent by each customer.

One level deeper, the customer detail shows a complete order history with the date of every purchase: more user friendly than searching and filtering the usual purchase log.

The WPEC built-in coupon code system has been improved to add per-user coupons and product IDs in conditions.

Custom goals can be set (and optionally shown in the front-end user purchase history), in order to enable and assign auto rewarded coupons.

Email notifications of rewards are sent to administrators, editors and optionally to customers (supporting the MailPress class).
